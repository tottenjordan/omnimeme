# Cloud Run Infrastructure

> **Assumes `/google-agents-cli-scaffold` scaffolding.** If your project isn't scaffolded yet, see `/google-agents-cli-scaffold` first.

## Scaling & Resource Defaults

Agents CLI scaffolds Cloud Run infrastructure in `deployment/terraform/single-project/service.tf` (and the `cicd/` variant). Check that file for current resource limits, scaling configuration, concurrency, and session affinity settings.

Key settings to be aware of: `cpu_idle` (CPU allocation strategy), `min_instance_count` (cold start avoidance), `max_instance_request_concurrency` (concurrency per instance), and `session_affinity` (sticky routing).

For how to size cpu/memory/workers/concurrency together (and avoid OOM), see **Sizing a deployment** in the `/google-agents-cli-deploy` skill.

## Dockerfile

Scaffolded projects include a `Dockerfile` using single-stage build with `uv` for dependency management. Check the project root `Dockerfile` for the exact configuration.

## FastAPI Endpoints

Scaffolded apps serve the ADK HTTP surface (`/run_sse`, `/apps/...`), A2A routes under `/a2a/{app_name}` (JSON-RPC + agent card — A2A is built into every ADK agent). Exact routes vary by template; check `app/fast_api_app.py`.

## Session Types

| Type | Configuration | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **In-memory** | Default (`shared://session` resolved by `app_utils/services.py` (in-memory)) | Local dev only; lost on instance restart |
| **Cloud SQL** | `--session-type cloud_sql` at scaffold time | Production persistent sessions (Postgres 15, IAM auth) |
| **Agent Runtime** | Managed Agent Engine sessions (`agentengine://{resource_name}`) | When using Agent Runtime as session backend |

The concrete session URI for `cloud_sql` / `agent_platform_sessions` is now built inside `app_utils/services.py`, not `fast_api_app.py`.

Cloud SQL session infrastructure (instance, database, Cloud SQL Unix socket volume mount) is configured in `deployment/terraform/single-project/service.tf`.

> **Manual Deployment Warning:** When using Cloud SQL without Terraform (e.g., direct `gcloud run deploy` with `--add-cloudsql-instances`), you MUST manually grant `roles/cloudsql.client` to the runtime service account, otherwise the connection will fail with authorization errors.

## Network & Ingress

Default ingress is `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_ALL` (public). To restrict, change the `ingress` setting in `service.tf` to `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_INTERNAL_ONLY` (VPC only) or `INGRESS_TRAFFIC_INTERNAL_LOAD_BALANCER` (internal + GCLB).

IAP (Identity-Aware Proxy) can be enabled by running `agents-cli deploy --iap` (Cloud Run only), which adds Google identity authentication without code changes. IAP is configured by the deploy flag, not by a generated Terraform variable.

VPC connectors are not configured by default. Add them in custom Terraform if needed for private resource access (see `references/terraform-patterns.md`).
